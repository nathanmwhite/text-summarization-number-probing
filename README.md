# Text summarization number probing

This repository contains the code for number probing of text summarization models, such as Pegasus. 

This represents the first step of the larger Hmong Medical Text Summarization project, which seeks to expand effective text summarization capability to low-resource languages.

This repository contains the following folders:
1. pegasus : code to run number probing for each task, with Pegasus defined as the default.
2. units_processing : processing code and text files containing the units for the Units and Context_Units probing tasks.
