# Text summarization number probing
## Pegasus

This folder contains the code to run number probing on Pegasus.

The three basic tasks for number probing (List Maximum, Decoding, Addition) were first proposed for static and contextual embeddings in Wallace et al. (2019). These will be implemented here in a new format that relies on generally available and up-to-date libraries as of 2022.
Beyond these, several additional number probing tests will be supported.

TODO:
1. Add Decoding and Addition model implementations to model.py.
2. Add test set evaluation with metrics.
